        <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
        <p>An aircraft in straight-and-level unaccelerated flight has four forces acting on it. (In turning, diving, or
            climbing flight, additional forces come into play.) These forces are lift, an upward-acting force; drag, a
            retarding force of the resistance to lift and to the friction of the aircraft moving through the air;
            weight, the downward effect that gravity has on the aircraft; and thrust, the forward-acting force provided
            by the propulsion system (or, in the case of unpowered aircraft, by using gravity to translate altitude into
            speed). Drag and weight are elements inherent in any object, including an aircraft. Lift and thrust are
            artificially created elements devised to enable an aircraft to fly.</p>
        <h2>Primary flight controls</h2>
        <p>All four forces—lift, thrust, drag, and weight—interact continuously in flight and are in turn affected by
            such things as the torque effect of the propeller, centrifugal force in turns, and other elements, but all
            are made subject to the pilot by means of the controls.</p>
        <h2>Propellers</h2>
        <p>Propellers are basically rotating airfoils, and they vary in type, including two-blade fixed pitch,
            four-blade controllable (variable) pitch, and eight-blade contrarotating pitch. The blade angle on
            fixed-pitch propellers is set for only one flight regime, and this restriction limits their performance.
            Some fixed-pitch propellers can be adjusted on the ground to improve performance in one part of the flight
            regime. Variable-pitch propellers permit the pilot to adjust the pitch to suit the flight condition, using a
            low pitch for takeoff and a high pitch for cruising flight. Most modern aircraft have an automatic
            variable-pitch propeller, which can be set to operate continuously in the most efficient mode for the flight
            regime. If an engine fails, most modern propellers can be feathered (mechanically adjusted) so that they
            present the blade edgewise to the line of flight, thereby reducing drag. In large piston engine aircraft,
            some propellers can be reversed after landing to shorten the landing run. (Jet engines have thrust
            reversers, usually incorporating a noise-suppression system, to accomplish the same task.)</p>
